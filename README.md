The Javascript on this page (calorease.html) will calculate calories per
pound in a food given either

  * calories per serving,
  * servings per package, and
  * ounces or grams per package

OR

  * calories per unit weight (ounces or grams)

The fields are grouped by background color.

The calories per pound field is disabled for input since it's intended to
provide the result of the calculation.
